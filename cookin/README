Install python3 and postgres
Install Heroku CLI
pip3 install requirements.txt
[add other steps that I might have forgotten here]

You will need to make your own .env file according to the .env.sample.
The .env file stores environment variables necessary for the app to run locally,
such as the name of the database.
On Heroku you can set the env vars at the app's settings page.

Useful commands:
heroku local web - lets you run local server
heroku open - lets you open the deployed app
heroku addons:open papertrail - lets you open and search the logs

Since we're on a free account the deployed app can only run 18 hours per day.
If it is idling Heroku will shut down the only Dyno (the worker process) that
we've got.
When you visit the page Dyno will restart.
I think for our purpose 18 hours per day and one Dyno is enough, but we'll see.

Please do not commit directly to the master branch.
Start a feature branch and do enough testing.
When you're done, submit a pull request on github.
